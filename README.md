# Conduct-a-security-audit
This scenario is based on a fictional company:

Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location, which serves as their main office, a storefront, and warehouse for their products. However, Botium Toy’s online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. 

The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She's worried about maintaining compliance and business operations as the company grows without a clear plan. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to internally processing and accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).   

The IT manager starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, listing assets currently managed by the IT department, and completing a risk assessment. The goal of the audit is to provide an overview of the risks and/or fines that the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture.

Your task is to review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment report. Then, perform an internal audit by completing a controls and compliance checklist.

Pro Tip: Save a copy of your work
  Finally, be sure to download and save a copy of your completed activity to your own device. You can upload it to the portfolio platform of your choice, then share with potential employers to help demonstrate your knowledge and experience.
  What to Include in Your Response
  Be sure to address the following elements in your completed activity:
  Controls and compliance checklist
  “Yes” or “no” is selected to answer the question related to each control listed
  “Yes” or “no” is selected to answer the question related to each compliance best practice
  A recommendation is provided for the IT manager (optional)

Step 3: Assess your activity
  The following is a self-assessment for your controls and compliance checklist. You will use these statements to review your own work. The self-assessment process is an important part of the learning experience because it allows you to objectively assess your security audit.
  There are a total of 5 points possible for this activity and each statement is worth 1 point. The items correspond to each step you completed for the activity. 
  To complete the self-assessment, first open your controls assessment and compliance checklist. Then respond yes or no to each statement. 
  When you complete and submit your responses, you will receive a percentage score. This score will help you confirm whether you completed the required steps of the activity. The recommended passing grade for this project is at least 80% (or 4/5 points). If you want to increase your score, you can revise your project and then resubmit your responses to reflect any changes you made. Try to achieve at least 4 points before continuing on to the next course item.
